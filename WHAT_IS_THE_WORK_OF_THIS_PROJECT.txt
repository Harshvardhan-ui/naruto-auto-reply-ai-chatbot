What is this project?

Naruto Auto-Reply AI Chatbot is a desktop automation + AI project that automatically reads chat messages from WhatsApp Web and sends humorous, roast-style replies using an AI model.

The chatbot behaves like a virtual character named Naruto, who responds in a funny and witty way based on the latest message in the chat — without human intervention.

🎯 What problem does this project solve?

Normally:

Humans must read messages

Think of a reply

Type and send it manually

This project:

Reads the chat automatically

Understands who sent the last message

Generates a smart, funny reply

Sends it automatically

➡️ It demonstrates AI-driven automation of real-world applications.

🧠 How does it work? (High-level)

The project works in 5 clear stages:

1️⃣ Desktop Automation

Using PyAutoGUI, the bot:

Opens the chat application (WhatsApp Web)

Moves the mouse automatically

Selects chat messages

Clicks the message input box

Presses keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+C and Enter

👉 This allows the bot to interact with applications just like a human.

2️⃣ Chat History Extraction

Using clipboard operations:

Selected chat text is copied

Text is retrieved from the system clipboard

This text becomes the input data for AI analysis.

3️⃣ Message Analysis

The bot:

Reads the copied chat history

Identifies who sent the last message

Checks whether the message is from a target user

This prevents unnecessary replies.

4️⃣ AI Response Generation

If the target user sent the message:

Chat history is sent to OpenAI’s GPT model

The AI generates a humorous Naruto-style roast reply

The reply is copied to clipboard

5️⃣ Automated Reply Sending

Finally:

The bot pastes the generated reply

Presses Enter

The message is sent automatically

All steps repeat in a loop.
